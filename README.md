# Snake-Game

Simple non-object oriented snake game that uses w, a, s, d keys to control the snake's movement. Eating a fruit will increase the number of tails by one. When the snake hits the wall or when the snake head collides with its tail, the game ends. The score will be displayed during game and after the game is over. Please maximize the console window  (or local windows debugger) while playing this game to optimize game performance!
